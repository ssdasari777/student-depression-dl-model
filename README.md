# Student Depression Prediction Using Deep Learning

This project applies deep learning techniques to predict whether a student is experiencing depression, based on structured survey data. The model is trained on various academic, psychological, and lifestyle features to perform binary classification (Yes/No).

## Project Highlights

- Goal: Detect depression in students using deep learning on tabular data.
- Dataset Size: 27,901 records Ã— 18 features.
- Model Type: Neural network (Binary classification).
- Features Used: Sleep duration, CGPA, suicidal thoughts, financial stress, etc.
- Outcome: Early detection can help educational institutions implement better support systems for student mental health.
